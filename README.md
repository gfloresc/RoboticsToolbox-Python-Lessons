# Robotics and Python Learning

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts, lecture materials, and hands-on exercises for the **Robotics and Automation** course. It serves as a resource for students learning both robotics concepts and Python programming.
The materials are designed to integrate theoretical robotics concepts with practical programming applications using **Python and the [Robotics Toolbox for Python (by Peter Corke)](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python)**.

## Contents
### ðŸ“‚ Code Examples
The repository includes well-documented Python scripts covering:
- **Kinematics**: Forward and inverse kinematics for robotic manipulators.
- **Trajectory Planning**: Path generation and execution.
- **Control Strategies**: Basic control approaches for mobile and articulated robots.
- **Simulation**: Using Python libraries to model and test robotic behavior.

### ðŸ“‚ Lecture Slides
The course slides provide theoretical insights on:
- Fundamentals of robotics (kinematics, dynamics, and control).
- Python programming for robotic applications.
- Simulations using the Robotics Toolbox for Python.

### ðŸ“‚ Lab Exercises
Structured lab assignments guide students through:
- Implementing kinematics and motion planning in Python.
- Using the Robotics Toolbox for simulations.
- Writing custom functions to analyze robotic parameters.

## Dependencies
To run the scripts in this repository, you will need the following Python libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib sympy roboticstoolbox
